## Introduction

This privacy policy describes how NetSketch ("we," "our," or "the app") handles information when you use our network diagramming application for iPad.

## Information We Collect

**NetSketch does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

NetSketch is a privacy-first application. We believe your network diagrams are your business, not ours.

## Data Storage

All network diagrams you create are stored:
- **Locally on your device** in your local storage
- **In your personal iCloud Drive** (if you choose to enable iCloud for the app)

We do not have access to your diagrams, cannot view them, and do not store them on any servers we control.

## iCloud Storage

If you enable iCloud Drive for NetSketch:
- Your diagrams are stored in your personal iCloud account
- Apple's iCloud Privacy Policy applies to this data
- We do not have access to your iCloud data
- You can disable iCloud sync at any time in iOS Settings

## Third-Party Services

NetSketch does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We don't use:
- Analytics platforms
- Advertising networks
- Crash reporting services
- Usage tracking
- Social media integrations

## Exported Files

When you export your diagrams:
- PNG and PDF files are created locally on your device
- You control where these files are shared or stored
- We do not receive copies of your exported files

## Children's Privacy

NetSketch is suitable for users of all ages. Since we don't collect any personal information, there is no special handling required for children under 13.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any personal data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. All data is stored locally on your device or in your iCloud account under your control.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.

## Data Security

Your diagrams are protected by:
- iOS built-in security features
- Your device passcode/biometric authentication
- iCloud encryption (if using iCloud sync)

We don't store any data on our servers, so there's no additional security concern from our end.

## International Users

NetSketch is available worldwide. Since all data is stored locally on your device or in your personal iCloud account, no data crosses borders to our servers.
